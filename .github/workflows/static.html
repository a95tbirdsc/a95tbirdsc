3 Rows of data coming from the Oracle select statment:

column data:

"data", "itemCount"

{"STUDENTPIDM":1,"STUDENTID":111,"STUDENTNAME":"Presley, Elvis","AIDYEAR":"2425","CATEGORY":"Deceased","CATEGORIES":null,"COMMENTS":"Wish he was still here"}, 3

{"STUDENTPIDM":2,"STUDENTID":222,"STUDENTNAME":"Monroe, Mariln","AIDYEAR":"2324","CATEGORY":"Deceased","CATEGORIES":null,"COMMENTS":"Really miss her."}, 3

{"STUDENTPIDM":3,"STUDENTID":333,"STUDENTNAME":"Dean, James","AIDYEAR":"2425","CATEGORY":"Deceased","CATEGORIES":null,"COMMENTS":"Cool Actor"}, 3


These three rows coming from the Oracle select statement would look like this after being fetched.  Don't have an example of the itemCount but I would assume just "3" after the "data" column.

0 Object {"STUDENTPIDM":1,"STUDENTID":111,"STUDENTNAME":"Presley, Elvis","AIDYEAR":"2425","CATEGORY":"Deceased","CATEGORIES":null,"COMMENTS":"Wish he was still here"}
1 Object {"STUDENTPIDM":2,"STUDENTID":222,"STUDENTNAME":"Monroe, Mariln","AIDYEAR":"2324","CATEGORY":"Deceased","CATEGORIES":null,"COMMENTS":"Really miss her."}
2 Object {"STUDENTPIDM":3,"STUDENTID":333,"STUDENTNAME":"Dean, James","AIDYEAR":"2425","CATEGORY":"Deceased","CATEGORIES":null,"COMMENTS":"Cool Actor"}


The three rows above need to be converted to the format below within the Fetch statement:

{
data: [ { ..row 1 of "data"...}, { ..row 2 of "data"..}, { ..row 3 of "data"..} ...],
itemsCount: n
}
